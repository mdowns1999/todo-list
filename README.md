# Overview

Welcome to my To-Do List Angular App! This application is a simple app that allowed me to practice building a full-stack Angular app. For the front-end portion, I used various parts of Angular like routing, services, binding, and HTTP requests.  I programmed this portion in Typescript, HTML, and CSS.  For the backend, I used Node JS, Express, and MongoDB.  For this portion, I simply just used Javascript and Node. I also used Bootstrap 3 for this project. I did this to experiment with bootstrap and I also wanted to focus more on using Angular and the backend resources.

# Development Environment

The IDE I used was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  I have used this IDE before and found it easy to use.  I also installed the nessicary packages like Node, Express, Bootstrap and Angular.

# Future Work
* Add more styling to the app. Make the List items look better.
* Possibly expand the layout of the page.
